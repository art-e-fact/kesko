<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<img src="media/nora-1.png" alt="drawing" style="width:500px;"/>
<br />

Nora is currently in its infancy and quite far from useful (but perhaps a bit fun to play around with). Currently it's more an exploration in the programming language Rust and what is currently possible within its open-source community. But, as time goes on the goal is to create a modern robotics simulator that fulfills

* Easiest simulator to get started with machine learning and robotics
* Best simulator for procedurally generate new environments for training
* Free and open-source
* Good looking!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

As stated Nora is quite useless at the moment but you can only play around with some of the built in models and experiment with the physics.
